# Google Image Scraper

A library created to scrape Google Images. Credits to [ohyicong](https://github.com/ohyicong) for the Google Image Scraper Repo. You can download the original [here](https://github.com/ohyicong/Google-Image-Scraper/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)

## Pre-requisites

1. Google Chrome
1. Selenium (pip install Selenium)
1. Pillow (pip install Pillow)

## Usage

This project was created to bypass Google Chrome's new restrictions on web scraping from Google Images.
To use it, define your desired parameters in main.py and run through the command line:

```
python main.py --search <search_terms> -n <no.images> -miss <no_skips>
```



## Setup

1. Open command prompt
2. Install Dependencies (**Bash Script**)
   ```
   setup/pip_setup_venv.bat
   ```
   or **pip**
   ```
   pip install -r setup/requirements/requirements.txt
   ```
3. Edit your desired parameters in main.py if need be
   ```
   search_keys         = Strings that will be searched for
   number of images    = Desired number of images
   headless            = Chrome GUI behaviour. If True, there will be no GUI
   min_resolution      = Minimum desired image resolution
   max_resolution      = Maximum desired image resolution
   max_missed          = Maximum number of failed image grabs before program terminates. Increase this number to ensure large queries do not exit.
   number_of_workers   = Number of sectioned jobs created. Restricted to one worker per search term and thread.
   ```
